1.10 Operating Systems
The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer.
The OS manages and controls a computerâ€™s activities. The popular operating systems for general-purpose computers are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Application programs, such as a Web browser or a word processor, cannot run unless an operating system is installed and running on the computer. Figure 1.5 shows the interrelationship of hardware, operating system, application software, and the user.
