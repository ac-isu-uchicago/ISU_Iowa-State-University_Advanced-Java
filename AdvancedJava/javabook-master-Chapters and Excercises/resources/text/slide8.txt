1.9 Programming Languages
Computer programs, known as software, are instructions that tell a computer what to do.
Computers do not understand human languages, so programs must be written in a language a computer can use. There are hundreds of programming languages, and they were developed to make the programming process easier for people. However, all programs must be converted into the instructions the computer can execute.
