/**
 * (Geometry: point in a circle?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
 * point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the circle centered at (0, 0)
 * with radius 10. For example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the
 * circle, as shown in Figure 3.7a.
 * (Hint: A point is in the circle if its distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10.
 * The formula for computing the distance is
 *        _________________________
 *      âˆš(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.
 *
 * Test your program to cover all cases.)
