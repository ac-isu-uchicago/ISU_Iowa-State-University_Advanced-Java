/**
 * (Algebra: solve 2 X 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following
 * 2 X 2 system of linear equation:
 *
 *      ax + by = e
 *      cx + dy = f
 *      x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
 *      y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
 *
 * Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 *
 *      3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 *      2.1x + .55y = 5.9
