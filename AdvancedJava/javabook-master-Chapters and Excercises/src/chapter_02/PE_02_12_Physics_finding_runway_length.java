/**
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 * speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 * take off using the following formula:
 *
 *      length = v^2 / 2a
 *
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
 * acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2)and displays the minimum runway
 * length.
