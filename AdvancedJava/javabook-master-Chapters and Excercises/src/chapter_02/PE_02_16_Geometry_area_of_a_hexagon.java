/**
 * (Geometry: area of a hexagon) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side
 * of a hexagon and displays its area. The formula for computing the area of a hexagon is
 *
 *      area = (3 * âˆš3 / 2) * s^2
 *
 * where s is the length of a side. Here is a sample run:
 *
 *      Enter the side: 5.5
 *      The area of the hexagon is 78.5918
 *
 * NOTE: Per the book's erata at http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro10e/errata.html,
 * In the output box for Programming Exercise 2.16, change 78.5895 to 78.5918.
