/**
 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to
 * heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should
 * prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final
 * temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
 *
 *      Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 *
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
 * and energy Q is measured in joules.
